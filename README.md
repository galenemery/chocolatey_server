This cookbook installs chocolatey server (and dependencies) for you.

As it stands, it assumes defaults and does not include any tunables.  Perhaps those will come with further work.

It also only includes some very basic unit tests, no integration tests as the author hasn't yet gotten kitchen working with a windows box to test on.
